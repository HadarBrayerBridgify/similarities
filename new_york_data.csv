Created in collaboration with Disney Theatrical Group, this tour takes you behind the magic at the New Amsterdam Theatre, entering when the theatre is closed for a special guided tour.Spend a full hour with the in-house historian, learning about the history of this incredible building. Have the place to yourself so you can visit the first floor and balcony levels, admiring the vast stage as your guide describes what goes into the creation and performance of a Broadway production like Beauty & The Beast, Mary Poppins, Aladdin and The Lion King. Hear stories of the goings-on behind the scenes and learn about the superstitions held by Broadway performers — including a few ghost stories.The highlight of your experience is in the second part of your New Amsterdam tour when you will visit the Prop Studio, where you’ll find treasures untold, getting up close and personal with original props, costumes and set piece for many of your favorite Disney on Broadway musicals.While you will spend a lot of time on the Disney element of our tour, the fun doesn't stop there: this is a proper Broadway tour.To ensure that you get a full picture of Broadway and that you have as much context as possible when you visit the New Amsterdam, you’ll take a guided tour of Broadway before your visit, stopping at landmark theatres where legendary shows drew huge crowds and global attention. For this section of the tour, you’ll travel with one of our Broadway Insiders, a team drawn from a bank of actors, crew members and even theatre mangers — all of whom have first-hand experience of life behind the curtain.Discover the unlikely origins of Times Square and hear the rags-to-riches tale of NYC’s theatre district (and how Disney was instrumental in changing the fate of a notorious red light district). Learn of the legendary Ziegfeld Follies which kick started Broadway production as we know it, not to mention the careers of so many legendary performers. You’ll also visit Sardi’s to see the famous character portraits, learning about the on and off-screen shenanigans of Broadway’s biggest names.With your Broadway Insider guide, you’ll see the most popular cast hangouts and identify the most important theatres — in both a historic sense and from a theatrical and musical standpoint. You’ll hear stories you’ll hardly be able to believe and get a grasp of just how colossal a Broadway production is; how much blood and sweat goes into every performance and how many people there are behind the scenes and in the wings every time the curtain rises.Like a theatre director on opening night, you can rest assured that we’ve taken painstaking care over the little details on this tour. We’ve chosen only the best guides to join our Broadway Insiders team and have drawn up the perfect route to showcase the very best of showbiz, combining the magic of Disney and the glamour of Broadway into one epic behind-the-magic adventure.Sites Visited:

 Behind every great food establishment in this city there is an equally great story of history, tradition and even innovation. On our food tours in New York City, you’ll discover these amazing histories while tasting what has made these eateries so prized among locals. About Sidewalk Tours...The story behind Sidewalks of NY Tours began a decade ago, when it's founder, J.D. Hirsch started taking friends and family on walking tours of the city he loves. His biggest motivation was to make sure his guests experienced The TRUE New York. Through years of exploration, he had discovered the secret hideaways, and hidden gems that make New York unlike any other city in the world. He combed the streets, tasting authentic ethnic cuisines and culinary delights not found in any guide books. His lengthy walking adventures took him to dinky mom-and-pop specialty food shops, and ethnic eateries, which have stood the test of time. He began compiling a best of list in search of the best delicatessens, bagel and knish shops, coffee houses, bakeries, candy stores, hamburger joints, pizzerias, and so much more. A friend, who was visiting from out of town, noticed J.D.'s passion and enthusiasm showing people his discoveries, and suggested he start a walking tour business. And the rest, as they say, is history. Our mission at Sidewalks of NY Tours is to give exceptional walking tours of New York, so our customers will revisit these neighborhoods with confidence, and enjoy the various cultural options they provide. Our creative and fun itineraries, and friendly and knowledgeable tour guides are committed to making your tour the highlight of your stay in The Big Apple.

Check out the best pizza and beer in Greenwich Village, a historical and cultural mecca on the West side, with the help of a licensed tour guide. You'll enjoy learning interesting tidbits and increase your cultural knowledge, all while savoring 3 pizza samplings and 2 beer tastings.About the Pizza: no neighborhood does pizza quite like Greenwich Village, with everything from amazing coal-fired thin crust pies, to traditional New York slices dripping with mozzarella cheese and oil, to newer ""pizzaioli"" (pizza makers), many recent immigrants from Italy, who are showcasing how pizza is cooked in their home regions in the Old Country. We have been eating pizza in the neighborhood for decades, and have scouted out 3 amazing spots to try 3 different styles of pizza. We will examine what makes each so unique, from inspiration to ingredients, to ovens.About the Beer: drinking in Greenwich Village has always been as big a part of the culture as music, painting and writing. Not even a little thing like Prohibition stopped the party -- the Village was home to some of New York’s most famous speakeasies, and we will enjoy a beer at one of its better-known former speakeasies. Learn how they snuck in the booze and kept their customers from getting arrested while enjoying drinks in the bars that helped transform Greenwich Village into “The Village” -- as much a state of mind as a physical neighborhood.Your 2.5-hour Pizza and Beer Tour includes:
- Enjoy 3 Pizza tastings from some of Greenwich Village’s best-known pizza restaurants
- Discuss the art of making pizza with one of New York’s top pizza chefs
- Toast to Village legends at 2 of the West Village’s most famous and notorious bars – including a former speakeasy and a bar that was one of the main hangouts of the Beat Generation. The first beer at each venue is on us!
- Insight, anecdotes and insider knowledge from your dynamic local tour guide
- Walk in the footsteps of some of America’s best-known writers, artists, and musicians along the quaint tree-lined streets and architecture of the West Village
- Be transported back to the many eras that made Greenwich Village so unique, and learn how Village luminaries lived and drank in the neighborhood. We’ll raise our glasses and toast those who have come before us – but this is not purely a pub crawl. We’ll be walking the same streets as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jackson Pollock, Dylan Thomas, Bob Dylan and other Village legends, chatting about what drew them all to this amazing corner of New York. We’ll schmooze, take photos and sightsee as well as eat and drink, learning the amazing stories of the Village and all of the establishments we visit. If you are looking for an experience that is solely a pub crawl, moving from bar to bar without the historical and cultural components, this is probably not the tour for you.
 About Sidewalk Tours...The story behind Sidewalks of NY Tours began a decade ago, when it's founder, J.D. Hirsch started taking friends and family on walking tours of the city he loves. His biggest motivation was to make sure his guests experienced The TRUE New York. Through years of exploration, he had discovered the secret hideaways, and hidden gems that make New York unlike any other city in the world. He combed the streets, tasting authentic ethnic cuisines and culinary delights not found in any guide books. His lengthy walking adventures took him to dinky mom-and-pop specialty food shops, and ethnic eateries, which have stood the test of time. He began compiling a best of list in search of the best delicatessens, bagel and knish shops, coffee houses, bakeries, candy stores, hamburger joints, pizzerias, and so much more. A friend, who was visiting from out of town, noticed J.D.'s passion and enthusiasm showing people his discoveries, and suggested he start a walking tour business. And the rest, as they say, is history. Our mission at Sidewalks of NY Tours is to give exceptional walking tours of New York, so our customers will revisit these neighborhoods with confidence, and enjoy the various cultural options they provide. Our creative and fun itineraries, and friendly and knowledgeable tour guides are committed to making your tour the highlight of your stay in The Big Apple. Let us guide you on a journey to discover The True New York!",,,,"199 Bleecker St",POINT (-74.00162 40.729501),https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/05/thumb_204759_cover_header.jpeg?w=540,,Musement,"02:30:00",0.0,0,false,68.81,https://www.musement.com/us/new-york/pizza-beer-and-history-tour-84176/?aid=bridgify&cid=bridgify,false,true,true,true,,"'{""Cuisine""}'","35e45df6-0c52-485c-a865-f224a7663ade",New York,,13,,

You will continue with a visit to the impressive Lincoln Memorial honoring the president who promoted the abolition of slavery in the United States.Washington D.C. is the center for all three branches of the U.S. government. During this tour you will stop for a classic outside view of the seat of two of them: the White House, home and office of the U.S. President and the Capitol Building, home of the U.S. Congress and where the laws of this country are made. Your visit to Washington concludes with free time for lunch on your own and a possible short visit to one of the Smithsonian museums, the world famous National Air and Space Museum.Your next destination is the first ever U.S. capital, chosen during the Revolutionary War: Philadelphia.

Your visit to Philadelphia concludes with a stop at the Rocky Steps, in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where you'll have an opportunity to re-enact the famous scene from the 1976 movie by ascending to the top of the steps.

The couple are then sent back to the audience to watch a fully improvised musical about the love story they just told. Every line, character, note, and dance move is created in the moment. But it’s really good! Like Hamilton but with more songs about dating apps.

This unique musical is the wholesome, celebratory antidote audiences need at this time. A celebration of couples of all stripes and their love.

Featuring two of the best musical improvisers and comedians you have never heard of (but you will soon, trust us) Evan Kaufman and Rebecca Vigil, plus an incredible band of musicians who simultaneously improvise with Evan and Rebecca as they create the melody and the lyrics.

Whether you are single or in a relationship, the combination of hard laughs and real emotions will make you feel that sincere butterfly stomach feeling that only real love can provoke.",,,,"21 A Clinton Street, New York, NY, 10002",POINT (-73.9843 40.72066),https://storage.googleapis.com/tickitto_assets/Production/events/1162-0-desktop.png,,Tickitto,"01:30:00",,0,false,17.13,,false,true,false,true,,"'{""Culture"",""Shows & Performances""}'","1162",New York,,13,,

On this five-hour excursion, your energetic guide will show you the best that these palatial museums have to offer. There will be time for a short break between both visits.

Start with the Met and its roughly two million works of art and artefacts covering everything from Ancient Egypt to modern art. From the Great Hall, you’ll visit the museum’s most important galleries. Pass through the Medieval Europe Gallery on your way to the Studiolo from the Ducal Palace. Explore armoury from the Middle Ages, including pieces worn by Henry VIII. The American wing hosts the staircase from the Chicago Stock Exchange as well as the famed portrait of Washington Crossing the Delaware. A host of European painters including Vermeer, Picasso, and Van Gogh awaits you as you learn about their troubled yet exciting lives.

After a break for lunch, check out a few of the 33 million objects housed in the American Museum of Natural History, covering basically all of Earth’s history. Begin with the museum itself as you learn about its history in the majestic Roosevelt Rotunda. Your guide will then reveal how the dioramas are made as you explore the giant African mammals of the Akeley Hall.

Then move towards the dinosaur exhibits where you’ll explore some of the most complete collections of dinosaur skeletons in the world. From the gargantuan titanosaur to the more familiar T-Rex, you’ll feel like a kid again as you learn their stories. You’ll then move on to hear about the North American Forests, featuring the giant Sequoia, before gazing up at the giant blue whale hanging overhead in the Hall of Ocean Life.
